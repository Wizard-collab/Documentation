Wizard Site
===========

Once **Wizard** is downloaded and installed, you need to set the location of the *Wizard Site*. The *Wizard Site* contains user and project data necessary for the operation of the pipeline.

  If your working on network and want to allow a multi-user work around your projects you must create the *Wizard Site* on this network and ensure that all the future user have an acess to this folder.
.. warning::

Softwares Settings
==================

After creating your user and a project, you are ready to start using **Wizard**.

Before creating an asset, you must fill in the software paths in the software settings. The location of each software depends on the installation you have done.

In this example, the maya softwares settings are set.

You can also add environnment variables and custom scripts paths. They will be loaded when you launch the software from the **Wizard Launcher**.

.. note::
  The software settings are written in the project settings. Each user connected to your project must have the same software installation. This ensure the Launcher to work. It is recommended to do a default installation of your software in order to guarantee the same software location between each user. Make sure each user have an access to the custom scripts and have the same environment variables set in this windows otherwise they won't be loaded.
